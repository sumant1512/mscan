## What I've Done

I've created a comprehensive debugging tool that will tell us EXACTLY why the Authorization header is missing from your products API requests.

**Files Created/Modified:**
- ✅ Auth interceptor updated with detailed logging
- ✅ Debug network tool created (`debug-network.component.ts`)
- ✅ Routes updated
- ✅ Instructions documented

## What You Need to Do (2 minutes)

### 1. Hard Refresh Your Browser
```
Press: Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
```
⚠️ **This is CRITICAL** - it ensures the new code is loaded!

### 2. Open the Debug Tool
Navigate to:
```
http://sumant.localhost:4200/debug-network
```

### 3. Open Browser DevTools
```
Press F12
→ Switch to "Network" tab
→ Switch to "Console" tab (or have both open)
```

### 4. Run All 3 Tests
Click each button in order and watch the results:

1. **"1️⃣ Test with HttpClient (Angular)"**
   - This goes through Angular's interceptor

2. **"2️⃣ Test with fetch() (Native)"**
   - This bypasses Angular entirely

3. **"3️⃣ Test with XMLHttpRequest (Native)"**
   - Another way that bypasses Angular

### 5. Check the Results
The page will show you which tests succeeded and which failed.

### 6. Check Network Tab
For EACH request in the Network tab:
1. Click on `/api/products?search=...`
2. Click "Headers" tab
3. Scroll to "Request Headers"
4. Look for: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

### 7. Report Back

Tell me:

**A. Console Output:**
- Did you see `🔒 Auth Interceptor` logs?
- Did you see `📋 Final request headers` with Authorization listed?

**B. Test Results:**
- ✅ or ❌ HttpClient
- ✅ or ❌ fetch()
- ✅ or ❌ XMLHttpRequest

**C. Network Tab:**
- Which requests had `Authorization: Bearer ...` header?

## Quick Example

**Expected Console Output:**
```
=== TEST 1: Angular HttpClient ===
🔑 Token found: eyJhbGci...
🔒 Auth Interceptor - URL: http://sumant.localhost:3000/api/products
🔑 Token exists: true
✅ Adding Authorization header
📋 Final request headers:
   Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGci...
✅ HttpClient SUCCESS
```

**Expected Network Tab:**
```
Request Headers:
  Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1Ni...
  Accept: application/json
  ...
```

## Why This Will Help

This test will tell us:
- ✅ Is the interceptor running?
- ✅ Is it adding the header to the request object?
- ✅ Is the header present in the actual HTTP request?
- ✅ Does the native fetch() work?

Based on the results, we'll know:
- **If fetch works but HttpClient fails** → Angular issue (browser extension, HttpClient bug)
- **If all fail** → Token issue (need to re-login)
- **If all work** → Issue is fixed or temporary

## Alternative If Tool Doesn't Load

If you get an error loading the debug tool:

1. Open Browser Console
2. Type: `localStorage.getItem('tms_access_token')`
3. Copy the token
4. Go to products page: `/tenant/products`
5. Open Network tab
6. Check if `/api/products` request has Authorization header
7. Screenshot and send

## Files to Read for Details

- **AUTH_DEBUG_SUMMARY.md** - Full technical details
- **FIX_MISSING_AUTH_HEADER.md** - Step-by-step troubleshooting guide

## Expected Time

- Hard refresh: 5 seconds
- Navigate to tool: 5 seconds
- Open DevTools: 5 seconds
- Run 3 tests: 15 seconds
- Check Network tab: 30 seconds
- Report results: 1 minute

**Total: ~2 minutes**
