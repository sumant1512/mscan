## Permission System

### Permission Model

**Permission-Based Authorization** controls what Tenant Users can access.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Super Admins** have all permissions automatically
- **Tenant Admins** have all permissions within their tenant
- **Tenant Users** must be explicitly granted permissions
- Permissions are assigned per user
- Permissions take effect immediately

### Available Permissions

**Product Management:**
```
VIEW_PRODUCTS          - View product list and details
CREATE_PRODUCTS        - Create new products
EDIT_PRODUCTS          - Modify existing products
DELETE_PRODUCTS        - Delete products
```

**Template Management:**
```
VIEW_TEMPLATES         - View template list
CREATE_TEMPLATES       - Create new templates
EDIT_TEMPLATES         - Modify templates
DELETE_TEMPLATES       - Delete templates
```

**Category & Tag Management:**
```
MANAGE_CATEGORIES      - Create/edit/delete categories
MANAGE_TAGS            - Create/edit/delete tags
```

**Coupon Management:**
```
VIEW_COUPONS           - View coupon list and details
CREATE_COUPONS         - Generate coupons
ACTIVATE_COUPONS       - Activate draft coupons
DELETE_COUPONS         - Delete coupons
EXPORT_COUPONS         - Export coupon data
```

REGENERATE_API_KEYS    - Regenerate API keys
```

EXPORT_SCANS           - Export scan data
```

### Permission Enforcement

**Frontend Enforcement:**
- Menu items hidden if user lacks permission
- Action buttons disabled/hidden
- Route guards prevent unauthorized access
- Components check permissions before rendering features

**Backend Enforcement:**
- Middleware validates permissions before processing requests
- API returns 403 Forbidden if permission missing
- Database queries filtered by user permissions
- Audit logs track permission-based access

**Example Permission Check:**
```typescript
// Frontend (Component)
hasCreatePermission(): boolean {
  return this.authService.hasPermission('CREATE_PRODUCTS');
}

// Template
<button *ngIf="hasCreatePermission()" (click)="createProduct()">
  Create Product
</button>

// Backend (Middleware)
const checkPermission = (requiredPermission) => {
  return async (req, res, next) => {
    if (req.user.userType === 'SUPER_ADMIN') {
      return next(); // Super Admin bypasses
    }

    const hasPermission = req.user.permissions.includes(requiredPermission);
    if (!hasPermission) {
      return res.status(403).json({
        success: false,
        message: 'Permission denied'
      });
    }

    next();
  };
};

// Route
router.post('/products',
  authenticate,
  checkPermission('CREATE_PRODUCTS'),
  productController.createProduct
);
```
