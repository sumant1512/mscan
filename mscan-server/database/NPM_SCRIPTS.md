## ⚙️ What Each Script Does

### `npm run db`
- Opens interactive menu
- Choose from 5 options
- Best for beginners

### `npm run db:setup`
- Creates database (if not exists)
- Creates all tables
- Runs migrations
- Creates Super Admins (sumantmishra511@gmail.com, kumarbhaskar419@gmail.com)

### `npm run db:clean-tenant`
- **DELETES**: All tenant users, products, coupons, scans
- **KEEPS**: Tenant records, Super Admin
- Asks for confirmation (type "CLEAN")

### `npm run db:clean-all`
- **DELETES**: ALL tenants, ALL data
- **KEEPS**: Super Admin only
- Asks for confirmation (type "DELETE ALL")

### `npm run db:drop`
- **DELETES**: Entire database
- **KEEPS**: Nothing
- Asks for confirmation (type "DROP")

### `npm run db:reset`
- Drops database (no confirmation)
- Sets up fresh database
- **USE WITH CAUTION!**

## 🛡️ Safety Features

✅ Most scripts require confirmation
✅ Shows what will be deleted before proceeding
✅ `db:reset` is the only auto-confirm script
✅ Press Ctrl+C to cancel anytime

---

## 📝 Notes

- All scripts are defined in `package.json`
- They call `database/db-manager.js` internally
- You can still use `node database/db-manager.js` directly if needed
- Use `--yes` flag to skip confirmations (direct node calls only)

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Command not found?**
Make sure you're in `/mscan-server` directory

**Permission denied?**
Make sure `db-manager.js` is executable:
```bash
chmod +x database/db-manager.js
```

**Database connection error?**
Check your `.env` file or environment variables

---

## 🎯 Remember

**One command to rule them all:**
```bash
npm run db
```

Then just follow the menu! 😊
